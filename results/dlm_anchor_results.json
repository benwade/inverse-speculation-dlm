These loans were often packaged into securities and sold as investments, leading to a housing bubble.\n\n2. **Securitization**: Banks created complex financial instruments called mortgage-backed securities (MBS) from pools of subprime mortgages. When these MBS became risky, investors lost confidence, causing a credit crunch.\n\n3. **Lehman Brothers' Collapse**: In September 2008, Lehman Brothers, one of the largest investment banks, filed for bankruptcy. This triggered a domino effect across the financial system, as many counterparties had invested heavily in Lehman's debt.\n\n4. **Government Response**: Governments around the world responded with various measures:\n   - **US Government**: Created the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to buy toxic assets from banks.\n   - **European Union**: Implemented bailouts for banks like AIG and provided liquidity support.\n   - **Global Central Banks",

This process, known as securitization, allowed banks to increase their lending capacity without needing to hold onto the assets themselves. However, when housing prices declined significantly after the bubble burst, many of these securities became worthless, leading to massive losses for investors.\n\n3. **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**: CDSs are contracts between two parties where one party pays another to guarantee payment on a debt if that debt defaults.
